/* This is the beauty of asyncronous javascript, asyncronous just means that it 
   is happening out of order, the beaty of the .then() blocks is that they don't block the other code in js program from running. They allowed second console log to run before the response from the fetch requeest ever came back from the server.
   
   There can be not only one console log, even 100 console logs will run before the fetch request get the response from the server.  */

/* Syncronous JS

   Each command must complete before the next command can execute
   No two commands can be ranning at the same time as each other
 
Asyncronous JS

   Code that can run out of order. Allows a lengthy operation to start, but finish at a later time without blocking other code from running in the meantime.
   
Why Asyncronous?
 
   JS isn't truly asyncronous, but rather has "callback" mechanisms in place to run commands in a different order to make things more efficinet.
   
   "Single-threaded" means only one command can run at a time. */
