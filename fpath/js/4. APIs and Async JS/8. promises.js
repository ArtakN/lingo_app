/* Promise is a special object that considers to be one of 3 states

   1. Pending state
         -the promise has yet to be completed (it is in the process) when we  write the fetch("") function, it take some time to get a response from the server after, we create a request

      from this pending state the promise can go one of 2 states

   2. Fullfilled (resolve) state
         -the promise was completed as promised
         
   3. Rejected state
         -the promise wasn't completed as promised    */

/* Quiz

1. What is a promise (in your own words)?

      A promise is an operation that normally takes a bit of time will eventually finish running. I.O.U. (I owe you)

2. Which part of the code we have so far is a promise?

      The fetch request returns a promise object.

3. What are the three states a promise can be in?

      (1) Pending, (2) Resolved (fulfilled), (3) Rejected

4. What does it mean when a promise is "resolved" (or fulfilled)?

      The task we wanted to perform finished successfully.

5. How do we tell the code to do something only AFTER a promise is resolved?

      with .then() method          */
