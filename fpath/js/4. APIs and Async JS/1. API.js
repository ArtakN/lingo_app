// client (request) - server (response) 

In what way do clients and servers interact with each other?
Client sends a request to a server, and the server sends back a response.

What is a request
   When a device asks for a "resource" (data, image, HTML page,
      atuthentication token, etc)
   Requires a connection to the connection somehow.

What is a response
   The replay to the request
   Could contain the resource (HTML, JSON data, etc) asked for
      by the client
   Could contain a response saying the client isn't authorized
      to recieve the response

What is the main job of a server?
Receive a request from a client and return a response.*/
