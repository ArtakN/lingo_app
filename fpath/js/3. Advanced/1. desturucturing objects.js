/* 
   object destructuring - an easier way to extract data from objects
*/

// =====================================================================
// we have an object and we want to extract some data from it
const favouriteFilm = {
   title: "Top Gun",
   year: "1986",
   genre: "action",
   star: "Tom Cruise",
   director: "Tony Scott"
}

// we can do it by creating a lot of varibles 
const title = favouriteFilm.title
const year = favouriteFilm.year
const genre = favouriteFilm.genre
const star = favouriteFilm.star
const director = favouriteFilm.director

// and then use them
console.log(`My favourite film is ${title} starring ${star}. 
                It's an ${genre} film that was released in ${year}`)

// if the object has not 5 but 50 properties it becomes very uncomfort way 

// there is a new way to destructure an object:
const { title, year, genre, star, director } = favouriteFilm
//  we will always use this type of destructuration

/*******************************************************************************
   To destructuring an object, we need to use variable names that match the property names of the object. If we use varible names that don't match the 
   object property name, we will get undefined for this varible.
*******************************************************************************/

// so we created 5 varibles with 1 const, and now we can use them
console.log(`My favourite film is ${title} starring ${star}.
            It's an ${genre} film that was released in ${year}`)

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// we don't have to list all properties, we need to write only properties that we will use. Js will match varible names and the object property names and create varibles for matched properties.
const { title, genre, star, year } = favouriteFilm

/* we have 5 properties in the object, but we created 4 varibles, 
   because here we need only these 4 varibles   */
console.log(`My favourite film is ${title} starring ${star}.
            It's an ${genre} film that was released in ${year}`)

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// real example of use

// we have 2 objects
const hero = {
   elementId: "hero",
   name: "Wizard",
   avatar: "images/wizard.png",
   health: 60,
   diceRoll: 3,
}

const monster = {
   elementId: "monster",
   name: "Orc",
   avatar: "images/orc.png",
   health: 10,
   diceRoll: 4,
}

// we create a function that get an object as a parameter
function renderCharacter(data) {

   // at first we desturucturing the incoming object
   const { name, avatar, health, diceRoll } = data

   // then we use creted varibles (object properties)
   document.getElementById('elementId').innerHTML =
      `<div class="character-card">
           <h4 class="name"> ${name} </h4>
           <img class="avatar" src="${avatar}" />
           <div class="health">health: <b> ${health} </b></div>
           <div class="dice-container">
               <div class="dice"> ${diceRoll} </div>
           </div>
       </div>`
}

// we call the  function and pass in it our objects as an argument
renderCharacter(hero)
renderCharacter(monster)
