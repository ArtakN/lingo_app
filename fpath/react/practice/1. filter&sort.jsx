/* Mockapi gives us an opportunity to filter and sort our data,
   for this we need to set the right request

   we need to write a code that when we change a category it will passed in the fetch request

   for exmple to sort items by price we need to get a url like this

      https://646fcd6809ff19b12087c5c4.mockapi.io/sortBy=price

   if we will have more thab one filter there need to be '&', like this

      https://646fcd6809ff19b12087c5c4.mockapi.io/sortBy=price&category=Mose  */
