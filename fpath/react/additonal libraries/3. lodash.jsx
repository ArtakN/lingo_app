/* loadash is a big libraray, it makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle 
   out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.

   Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

      -Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
      -Manipulating & testing values
      -Creating composite functions                   */

// debounce is a function from lodash library. it looks like setTimeout()

/* to use debounce function we need to install the lodash liberary

      npm install lodash
    
   or if we will use only debonce function, we can install exactly debounce funtion   

      npm install lodash.debounce

   then we need ot import it to the component to use it  */
