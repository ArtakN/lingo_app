   Semnatic HTML tags allows to be much more descriptive, as the tags much more closely the content they hold. There are a lot of semantic html tags, but 5 of them, we will use as usuall as posiblle:
         
      <header>    - Site title, logo, and nav
      <nav>       - Navigation 
      <main>      - The page's unique content   
      <section>   - A stand-alone section
      <footer>    - Copyright, Ts & Cs, etc.
            
   a main tag may holds several section tags
   a main tag should'nt hold a header or a footer, becaause they are normaly no uniqe content, they are the same on each page
